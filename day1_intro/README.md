Think about this
------------
**Do you need airflow?**
<br>
Before starting to use it, I recommend you do research and consider this question
<br>
"Do I use the pros like dynamic, scalable and workflow as code, or airflow is just another cron to run scripts"
<br>
There are tons of advantages to airflow, I really love it, but still need more time to take care of it.
<br>
I believe "Simple is the best", so think about it before you decide to use it.
