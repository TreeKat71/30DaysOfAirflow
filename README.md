30 Days Of Airflow
------------
As work needed, I start to learn about building data pipeline and how to use apache airflow. I really love its design and how it works, so I decide to share my experience to who are going to learn airflow.
<br>

In this tutorial, I will cover things below:
- Introduction & definition
- Core concept (dag, operators ...)
- Basic operators
- Additional features (var, xcom, branch, hook, conn...)
- Tips & Tricks
- Dockerize
- More advanced features(may not cover)


Hope you can learn from it : )
